Welcome to my dissertation blog! Mostly ignore what I am rambling on about - the information that is here will be used as more of a memory jog for myself than something publicly used, but hey - why not?

My dissertation is based on an issue posed by the NHS Wales Informatics Service. With more and more younger nurses and doctors coming onto the nations wards, they wanted to update the way that they decide on what drugs to prescribe to the patients - where the normal technique is to use a book or a website. This is an issue on most wards/travelling doctors, as there is over subscription to the terminal in the ward or no internet access at the remote area they are called out to.

My project is to fit the Formulary information, based on health board, onto a mobile device so they are able to access the information where ever they need it!

Look out for additional updates
