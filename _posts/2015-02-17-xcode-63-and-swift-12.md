title: "Xcode 6.3 and Swift 1.2"
---

Currently I have been using XCode 6.1.1 and Swift 1.1 for the development, but currently I have moved over to Xcode 6.3 and Swift 1.2. The main reason is that [Quick](http://github.com/quick/quick) is currently only supporting 1.2 and above. I was wary of this, but I then realised (thanks to [borntyping](http://github.com/borntyping)) that Swift is still highly unstable and new, so developing for the bleeding edge will mean that a) migrating it down the line will be easier and b) more and more
of the frameworks are better suited to the bleeding edge, as there is no point in developing for older versions
